# node-starter
A Boiding workshop starter kit using node

## Registering to the workshop server
The `package.json` describes a `register` script that can be used to register
your team. It can be invoked via

```sh
npm run register <team-name>
```

The script needs an argument; the team name. If you are looking for inspiration,
why not join your favorite color, your favorite city and your favorite animal
with dashes. E.g. my team name would be yellow-nijmegen-ant.
